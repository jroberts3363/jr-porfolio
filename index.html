       <h2>Thank you for visiting my portfolio site.</h2>
       <p>Hello! I am Jesse Roberts; creativity is my passion and I strive to continue learning new skills and techniques to create "outside-of-the-box" pieces. Above all, I am a family man. Together, with my wife and two boys, we love going on roads trips and finding inspiration; wherever the road takes us. </p>
	   <p>Below is a collection of work I've designed during my time studying at Conestoga College in the Advertising and Marketing Communications program. These pieces are a combination of real client work, self-picked local clients, and a self-developed business model.</p>
       <p>Enjoy scrolling through the gallery pages below. Feel free to contact me via the contact form at the end.</p>

	     <h3 class="white-type">Cambridge, Ontario</h3>
         <p class="white-type">This is a local brewery located in the historic Hespeler Village. They are masters at the craft of beer making and are becoming a leading edge brewery in the Tri-Cities. I designed a series of pieces: a pamphlet, a whitepaper, and a beer label. All of my designs are aimed to show their rustic-modern style and sense of community.</p>
	     <p class="white-type">The beer label for their "It Takes A Village" lager was a class contest and my design chosen to become a part of their line. It will soon be on the shelves and sold with their other amazing brews. This is definitely a beer you need to try!</p>

	     <h3 class="galt-juice">Cambridge, Ontario</h3>
         <p class="galt-juice">This is a local business located in beautiful downtown Galt. I designed a digital campaign for this company as a concept project for Conestoga College. My goal with this campaign was to generate awareness for the company's cold-pressed juices. I designed ads that will target two separate target markets. The first series targets Millennials, using bold colours and humour; the second series targets the Baby Boomers, boasting more about their healthiness. Both series' have capabilities to run on social media platforms and Google Ads.</p>

		   <h3 class="white-type">Are you a proud Canadian?</h3>
           <p class="white-type">There are still many negative stigmas in our country regarding various religions. I designed this campaign as another concept project at Conestoga College with the goal to increase awareness on this issue. I based this campaign using the Office of Religious Freedom in Canada as my client.</p>
	       <p class="white-type">I used misdirection and a bold headline for my designs. The intention was to immediately have people thinking about multiculturalism in a positive perspective. Each ad in the series focuses on a specific religion using positive colours that correlate with their religion. Are you a proud Canadian?</p>

          <h2>Lemon Lemon</h2>
		  <h3>A sparkling beverage company.</h3>
          <p>Lemon Lemon is a line of sparkling water which is a branch of PepsiCo. I designed this campaign as another concept project at Conestoga College. The beverage industry is extremely competitive, so I designed ads that will stand out and generate attention.</p>
	      <p>These ads are fun and creative, using catchy taglines "Easy Peezy, Lemon Squeezy." and "Water. Reimagined." Using bold colours and imagery that correspond with each flavour was important to me, allowing a further connection to the brand. I want you to feel as though you can almost taste it.</p>

		  <h3 class="white-type">A prototype company designed for families</h3>
          <p class="white-type">This was an entrepreneur project I developed at Conestoga College. It is an easy-to-navigate app and website designed to help bring families together. The concept was inspired by my family; our schedules are busy and we always seem to have somewhere to be. Making quality family time together is important to us, and with Jovial, I plan to make that happen for all families.</p>
